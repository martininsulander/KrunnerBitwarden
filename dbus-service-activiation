I couldn't make dbus activiation for user session, but it is an interesting idea

some info here
https://develop.kde.org/docs/d-bus/dbus_autostart_services/
but it should be possible with /etc/dbus-1/services.d/...service too

martinin@HIQGBGL0397 ~/.dbus/services cat mi.secretservice.krunner.service 
[D-BUS Service]
Name=mi.secretservice.krunner
Exec=python3 krunner.py
Path=/home/martinin/.local/share/krunner/plugin/miSecretService/
